It all started with me asking too many “why’s” until I discovered that data had a language for every one of them. What began as curiosity turned into a lifelong fascination with how information shapes the world around us.

I’m Aditya Kanbargi, a data scientist who loves uncovering stories hidden inside messy, beautiful data. For me, data isn’t just numbers and models; it’s a way to understand people, decisions, and the little patterns that make big things happen. It all started with me staring at a dataset like it was a mystery novel, every column a clue and every row a story, and I’ve been hooked on solving those stories ever since.

I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at The George Washington University (GPA 4.0), where I was awarded the Global Leaders Fellowship for academic excellence. Between projects on machine learning, NLP, and cloud computing, I’ve learned that the magic of data science lies in connecting technical depth with real-world impact.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked across public health and enterprise analytics, building everything from early-warning prediction systems that help clinicians act faster to dashboards that power smarter business decisions. At GW’s School of Nursing, I helped create ML models that detect patient deterioration risks before they happen. Earlier, at LTIMindtree, I worked on predictive analytics and automation pipelines that made business insights faster, cleaner, and more reliable.

I’m fluent in Python, R, and SQL, and love experimenting with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and LangChain. Whether it’s designing an LLM-powered research assistant or optimizing a data workflow in the cloud, I enjoy building solutions that feel as good to use as they are to explain.

Outside the world of code and models, you’ll probably find me at the gym, watching football, or diving into a good read. I’m driven by curiosity, caffeine, and the thrill of turning raw data into something that tells a great story — one that actually means something.
